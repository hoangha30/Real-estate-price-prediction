# Linear Regression Real Estate Price Prediction

This project aims to predict real estate prices using a linear regression model. The analysis is performed in a Jupyter Notebook, where data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation are implemented.

## Project Overview

Real estate price prediction is a classic regression problem. In this project, we use a dataset containing various property features such as transaction date, house age, distance to the nearest MRT station, number of convenience stores, latitude, and longitude to predict the house price of a unit area. The main steps include:

- **Data Preprocessing:**  
  Cleaning and preparing the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  Visualizing the data distributions and relationships between features using libraries such as Matplotlib and Seaborn.
- **Model Building:**  
  Training a linear regression model using Scikit-learn to learn the relationship between property features and sale prices.
- **Model Evaluation:**  
  Assessing the performance of the model using evaluation metrics such as RMSE, MAE, and RÂ².
